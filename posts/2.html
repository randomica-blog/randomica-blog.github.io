        	<h3>I have a powerful Mac. I want a €100 PC.</h3>
        	<h4><time datetime="2026-01-01">2026-01-01</time></h4>
		<p>In July 2024 I bought a MacBook Pro running an M3 Pro processor. An incredible piece of hardware: so powerful that the half would be enough, a beautiful display, stunning audio, a so long battery life that I get tired before it. Maybe a little bit heavy, but it's a strong computer.</p>
		<p>I love the hardware, I appreciate the software and the integration with the ecosystem. I do not appreciate the direction of the last updates, but I feel this as a stable and accountable machine.</p>
		<p>Despite this, there's something that I always wanted to do. Something that every once in a while jumps in my mind: I want a Lenovo Thinkpad and have fun on Linux with it. I have always viewed Thinkpads as timeless tanks capable of anything, especially when running Linux, especially if you want to dedicate them a little of your time.</p>
		<p>I'm fascinated by how you can revive old hardare if it was well designed to be hacked, manipulated and fixed. Old thinkpads are basically like assembled desktop computers, you can replace almost everything (even the CPU). I realistically want a modern PC, I can exchange the interchangeability of some core parts (this is like a long-term PRO) for some features that I can appreciate immediately: a decent looking screen, a USB-c driven power input.</p>
		<p>This machine will serve me as a typing and coding machine, but this is something that I can obviously do with the tools I already have. The real reason (It's hard to call it a <em>necessity</em>) I want this computer is <strong>to play with Linux!</strong></p>
		<p>Ok, I said it. It's just to jump on some Linux distros after almost 8 years of using MacOS basically every day. The Linux environment has always had a special charm. Maybe caused by the old-school vibe, when devs and users were "intentional", implementing things efficiently and exploring smart ways to overcome limitations. It's another thing that is hard to explain, I'll expand on this idea in a future post.</p>
		<p>There are several inputs that led me to mature this desire. Starting from this beautiful article: <a href="https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2020/12/how-and-why-i-stopped-buying-new-laptops">"How and Why I Stopped Buying New Laptops"</a> by Kris De Decker. But also several Reddit posts and YouTube videos about restoration of old netbooks used as digital writing machines thanks to a finetuned Linux distribution. Last (but not least) I bought a Steam Deck running that piece of art that is SteamOS with KDE Plasma. I define it as a piece of art for what Steam was capable of doing when SteamOS and Proton were launched. I loved that Steam led the boost of Linux inside the <em>'PC gaming community'</em>.</p>
		<p>But another reason is that I really want to learn modern Linux, I believe that is so easy in the current state of the art to use an open computer with few tradeoffs. I want to force myself to use only open-source programs and tools to make all I want from a computer. I want to take part of the Linux propaganda. I want a conversation starter to tell to some curious people: "It is doable. And it is easier than in the past. Easier than you think."</p>
