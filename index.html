	<h1>Randomica</h1>
	<p>Hello, world! This is the first (not actually, but ok) page of <em>~Randomica</em> blog!</p><br>
	<p>I want to write the code of this website, but also the articles' text only with the vim text editor.<br>If you don't know it; <em>vim</em> is a command line text editor. It's a minimal program accessible only via the Terminal app. I want to play with this minimal environment for two main reasons: [1] this minimal environment seems to be very stimulating; [2] a text editor without color syntax and suggestions forces you to really think about the code you are writing</p><br>
	<h3>What if this was a single, infinite HTML page?</h3>
	<h4><time datetime="2025-12-19">2025-12-19</time></h4>
	<p>What if this blog was a unique HTML page, where every &lt;p&gt; tag was an article? It's a bullshit, for sure.<br>
It's a standard for several blogs to have an infinite home page with all the articles. But they are divided in pages and you can open a single one, you have a link for them to share etc.<br>
	Writing in vim is so fun. I still struggle with some commands but this is the best way to learn and "install" things on your muscle memory. I don't know if writing directly inside the HTML page is the best choice. I feel that there is something wrong because it's a huge and complex page; you take the risk of doing something that entirely breaks the page without knowing it (this is another reason for dividing this blog in several pages). But we'll see. In this way I feel to have the full control on the webpage. I can directly change the structure (even if it's so simple), the impagination, aesthetics, and so on. But I have to decide which way is the best. Maybe writing in a plain txt file and implement the text later. Now, I can type :w and check on my browser how this page looks. I should check how it looks like on Lynx browser.</p><br>
