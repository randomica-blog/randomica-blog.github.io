		<h1>Randomica</h1>
	        <p>Hello, world! This is the first (not actually, but ok) page of <em>~Randomica</em> blog!</p><br>
			<p>I want to write the code of this website, but also the text for the articles using only the vim text editor.<br>If you don't know it; <em>vim</em> is a command line text editor. It's a minimal program accessible only via the Terminal app. I want to play with this minimal environment for two main reasons: [1] this minimal environment seems to be very stimulating; [2] a text editor without color syntax and suggestions forces you to really think about the code you are writing.</p><br>

                In July 2024 I bought a MacBook Pro running an M3 Pro processor. An incredible piece of hardware: so powerful that the half would be enough, a beautiful display, stunning audio, a so long battery life that I get tired before it. Maybe a little bit heavy, but it's a strong computer. Despite this, I want to buy a cheap computer.<br>

		<p>I fell in love with this idea while leafing through my sister's art storybook. I wanted to save it on this space.</p><br>

		Ok. I turn off the lights. Everyone is sleeping. An almost black screen with a column of purple tildes and the only two lines of white text that I just wrote.<br>
		This is the basic screen of Vim when you open a new file to start typing. There's only one other element on the screen. On the last line, bottom-left portion of this digital, mutating space that is my display. There's something that reads as a mix between an invite and an imperative command:<br>

		<h2>What if this was a single, infinite HTML page?</h2>
		<h4><time datetime="2025-12-12">2025-12-12</time></h4>
		<p>
			What if this blog was a unique HTML page, where every &lt;p&gt; tag was an article? It's a bullshit, for sure.<br>
			It's a standard for several blogs to have an infinite home page with all the articles. But they are divided in pages and you can open a single one, you have a link for them to share etc.<br>
			Writing in vim is so fun. I still struggle with some commands but this is the best way to learn and "install" things on your muscle memory. I don't know if writing directly inside the HTML page is the best choice. I feel that there is something wrong because it's a huge and complex page; you take the risk of doing something that entirely breaks the page without knowing it (this is another reason for dividing this blog in several pages). But we'll see. In this way I feel to have the full control on the webpage. I can directly change the structure (even if it's so simple), the impagination, aesthetics, and so on. But I have to decide which way is the best. Maybe writing in a plain txt file and implement the text later. Now, I can type :w and check on my browser how this page looks. I should check how it looks like on Lynx browser.<br>
			Update on Lynx: the overall content is perfect, but I lose all the CSS content like colors and the <strong>tilde</strong> that is automatically added to headers. However, I think this is exactly what pepole want to see when navigating the web on a text based browser like Lynx.<br>
