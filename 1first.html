                Ok. I turn off the lights. Everyone is sleeping. An almost black screen with a column of purple tildes and the only two lines of white text that I just wrote.<br>
                This is the basic screen of Vim when you open a new file to start typing. There's only one other element on the screen. On the last line, bottom-left portion of this digital, mutating space that is my display. There's something that reads as a mix between an invite and an imperative command:
                <br><br>
                <strong>-- INSERT --</strong>
		<br><br>
                There is something magical in this meditative action that is writing during the night, alone. Either if it is directly writing with pen and paper or if it is typing on the keyboard looking at the display. I love the fact that you are almost isolated. Without other external input. Without other people asking you what you are doing, why you are doing it.<br>
                Maybe it's a personal problem, but I always felt something like shame when I start something personal like this blog.It is probably caused by the cultural environment that is typical in the city where I passed my youth. There is this tendency to discourage the ambition of new initiatives. It's something hard to explain. If I have to use an example, I would say that the people always find pointless to start a musical project, until it already became "famous" and successful.<br>
                So I feel like this and I don't like to make this stuff in public. But I still love typing my toughts and putting them in order in my mind. It's hard to write well and properly, creating a path of ideas and emotions that feels cohesive and makes sense. It requires practice and time. I'm writing this stuff more for me than for others, but I would love to produce some writings with the idea that they would be read by other people.<br>
                This would require a proper commitment: to put ideas in order, to organize an outline, to write down the first draft, to read the text again and again. To think about a person that reads the text for the first time without the background that you, the writer, have after all the work done.<br>
                It's a little bit late and in a minute I'll be disturbed :) End of the file<br>
